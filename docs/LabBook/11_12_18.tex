\subsection{Steps}
\begin{itemize}

	\item We implemented \textit{KNearestNeighbors} algorithm. We did the classification with a range of neighbors from 1 to 30 and we saved the neighbor with the best score. Then we did \textit{KNN} with the best neighbor.
	
	\item We implemented \textit{Random Forest Classifier}. Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.
