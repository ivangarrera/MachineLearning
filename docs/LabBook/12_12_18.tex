\subsection{Steps}
\begin{itemize}

	\item We were doing the prediction with \textit{zero\_one\_loss} metric that it returns the fraction of misclassifications. The results weren't so good and we didn't get a clear interpretation of them.
	
	\item After trying different metrics we chose \textit{hamming\_loss} metric that it returns the fraction of labels that are incorrectly predicted. We obtain better result so we realized \textit{KNN} with this metric.
	
\end{itemize}
