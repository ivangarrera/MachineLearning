\subsection{Steps}
\begin{itemize}
\item First, we have created a \textit{cookiecutter} based directory structure. 

\item Then, we have revised the dataframe.

\item We have deleted non numerical columns, it means, the columns that contain string values.

\item We have deleted the columns which had all \texttt{NaNs}. If we don't have care enough and we try to delete rows with \texttt{NaNs} directly, we will delete the complete dataset, because there are some columns with all null values.

\item We have removed duplicate rows, that is, two or more rows with exactly the same values. We have seen that in this dataset there are not duplicate rows. 

\item We have deleted the rows containing not a number (\texttt{NaNs}) values.

\item We have tried to identify some outliers in some columns but we haven't have success.
\end{itemize}
